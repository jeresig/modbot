			<p>This system is designed to help submitters to sub-Reddits better understand what's happening with their posts and potentially self-moderate.</p>
			<p>Do you have a post that could be stuck in moderation? Use the following form to check a URL:</p>
			<form action="" method="GET">
				<p>Reddit Post URL: <input type="text" name="url" size="40" value="{{referer}}" /><br/>
					<small>(For example: <em>http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/edj1w/changing_wifes_tire_true_story/</em>)</small></p>
				<p><input type="submit" value="Check Reddit Post" /></p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> You are only allowed to do 5 URL checks per day.</p>
			</form>
		{{/nourl}}
		
		{{#wrongsub}}
			<p>The URL that you submitted does that correspond to a currently-supported sub-Reddit.</p>
		{{/wrongsub}}
		
		{{#showsub}}
			<p>Right now the auto-moderation system only works in the following sub-Reddits:</p>
			<ul>
				{{#reddits}}
					<li>{{.}}</li>
				{{/reddits}}
			</ul>
		{{/showsub}}
		
		{{#invalid}}
			<p>This doesn't appear to be a Reddit discussion URL. A proper URL has the form:
				<br/><tt>http://www.reddit.com/r/somereddit/comments/id/the_name_of_the_post/</tt></p>
		{{/invalid}}
		
		{{#nopost}}
			<p>The post that you linked to does not appear to exist. Perhaps try submitting it again?</p>
		{{/nopost}}
		
		{{#about}}

		{{/used}}
		
		{{#approved}}
			<p>Your post has been removed from Reddit's spam queue. Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
