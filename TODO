 - Build customized rules / filters and auto-messages for Sub-Reddits
   e.g. images one for f7u12, self posts only for IAMA

 - Give ReportTheSpammers mods the ability to ban people across all Reddits

 - Some way to do community-enforced NSFW tagging. Perhaps this builds into the reporting feature?
